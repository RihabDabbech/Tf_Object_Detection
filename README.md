# Tf_Object_Detection
This project aims to provide a starting point for developing a custom object detection model by leveraging the COCO dataset for training and evaluation.

## Overview
Object detection is a crucial task in computer vision that involves detecting objects within an image and locating them with a bounding box. This project uses the COCO dataset, which is a large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset. The goal of this project is to provide a framework for developing a custom object detection model using TensorFlow.
